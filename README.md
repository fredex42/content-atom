# Content Atom Model Definition

This is the Thrift definition of the Content Atom model, and the published
versions of this repository are built from the autogenerated code in various
languages.

## How to release

```
$ sbt release
```

This will release 2 artifacts to Maven Central:

* `content-atom-model_2.11-$version.jar` contains the Thrift files and Scrooge-generated Scala 2.11 classes
* `content-atom-model-thrift-$version.jar` contains only the Thrift files

You will need a PGP key and Sonatype credentials.

### JavaScript

To release the JS models to npm:

1. Bump the version number in `package.json`

2. Um, not sure. Ask Rob Rees or someone who knows about JS.
